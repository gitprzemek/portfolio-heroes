    "DESCRIPTION": "Hi! I'm PRZEMEK and I create websites and web applications. I think that I am a multi-talented person who professes the principles that you can learn everything, all you have to do is want. I'm a good example myself. \nIn my free time I relax while watching a comedy, for example with Jim Carrey or I care that my body will still look and fit my old clothes. In addition, a great fan of Blizzard, old classic games and movies."
